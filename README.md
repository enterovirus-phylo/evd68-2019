# Nextstrain Runs for the paper "(Add paper title when finalized)"

This repository contains the Nextstrain augur pipeline output files which allow vizualisation of the result via the 'community' feature on Nextstrain. 

You can check out the run here: [nextstrain.org/community/enterovirus-phylo/evd68-2019/vp1-300](https://nextstrain.org/community/enterovirus-phylo/evd68-2019/vp1-300).

You can view the whole manuscript [here]() *(paper link will be added once published)*.

This analysis was created with sequences of EV-D68 sampled from across Europe in 2019, mainly during the Autumn. VP1 sequences from 2019 with >=300bp were included in a background of all publicly available VP1 sequences at least >=700bp. 

This was run with the Nextstrain augur Enterovirus D68 pipeline. You can see the current code [here](), and the frozen version (the exact version used to run this result) [here](). *(These links will be added once the code is online.)*
